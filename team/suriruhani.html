<p>Our project, the Infinity Machine, is an application useful for efficient management of textual information
of any kind, say research material. It allows users to store information by the their <strong>title</strong>, <strong>type</strong>, <strong>details</strong> and multiple <strong>tags</strong> and allows
for easy search, retrieval, edit and delete functions. Intended to be used through the Command Line Interface, and intended
for tech-savvy, university students looking for an efficient, simple yet powerful way of maintaining their resources.</p>

<h4 id="1-modified-strong-the-ability-to-search-strong-through-sources"><a class="link" href="#1-modified-strong-the-ability-to-search-strong-through-sources">1. Modified <strong>the ability to search</strong> through sources:</a></h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-modification-strong"><a class="link" href="#strong-modification-strong"><strong>Modification</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>search [n/TITLE] [y/TYPE] [d/DETAILS] [t/TAG] [t/TAG]&#8230;&#8203;</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work I have done on AB4&#8217;s search feature can be divided into 3 major modifications as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple prefix tags of different (and same) kinds</strong>: The search function now has an added functionality of being able to take in multiple
arguments of the <strong>same</strong> and <strong>different</strong> type of source fields, and search for sources based on its conjunction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Substring matching with incomplete words</strong>: It is enabled with substring matching as against exact field matching.
Each argument is checked for its presence inside the source
fields and a source is found only if all the user entered arguments are present inside the source&#8217;s respective field values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-correction feature for typing mistakes</strong>: It is also able to find string matches with minor typing errors in the spelling,
implemented using Levenshtein distance or the edit distance. The implementation current accounts for less than 3 character swaps needed to transform between the strings
(lower bounded by the difference in the string lengths of the two strings).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-what-it-does-strong"><a class="link" href="#strong-what-it-does-strong"><strong>What it does</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It allows the user to search through all the entries in the database through various fields at a time, same and different, and display
source entries that satisfy all of the entered tags in conjunction, with substring matching and typo accommodation.
It allows compound searches to be made, allowing user to narrow down their search, hence helping in efficient retrieval
of the sources, and making working on the database more efficient. It also reduces the onus on the user to remember and recall
the source entries maintained by allowing them to enter as many consecutive characters for a field value they can enumerate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-justification-strong"><a class="link" href="#strong-justification-strong"><strong>Justification</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now search an entry with a particular title AND a particular type and so on.
Furthermore, it removes the reliance on the user to memorize exact field values, by enabling substring matching and multiple tags
entered so the user can enter as much as he remembers and see the results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It helps user greatly narrow down their search should they be looking for a specific source entry with particular values,
instead of cluttering the screen with all those sources with share the same title as the one the user searches using the command.
It also allows user to search sources based on other fields and not just title, such as type, tags and details, and even their
logical combination, along with allowing the user to not memorize his source fields.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-highlights-strong"><a class="link" href="#strong-highlights-strong"><strong>Highlights</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, it changed the format of the original <code>search</code> command, which now not only takes parameters of different types, but also needs them to be prefixed by their
CLI delimiters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any seemingly unwanted results are displayed after a search command is executed, it should not be seen as a bug as this is
the intended behaviour because of the two features that render the search result space more broadened than before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest assured, the intended results will never be missed out.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>list [N] [M]</code><br>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new modification to the command changes its format optionally, allowing user to be able to pass either one, two or no parameters
and list only those many sources from the entire source list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The various formats now accepted are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong><code>list</code> with no arguments</strong>: Works as the original <code>list</code> command and shows all the sources and their details, unfiltered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>list N</code> with one positive argument</strong>: Shows the top N sources with all their details only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>list -N</code> with one negative arguments</strong>: Shows the last N sources or the TOp N sources from the bottom with their details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>list N M</code> with two positive arguments</strong>: With M&gt;=N, shows sources between the indices N and M with all their details only.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these resulting sources are appropriately numbered as 1, 2 .. and so on regardless of their index in the original source list.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-what-it-does-strong-2"><a class="link" href="#strong-what-it-does-strong-2"><strong>What it does</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It allows the user to now pass optional arguments to <code>list</code> command and then displays only those indexed source entries in the original source database as per the cases above.
The original working of the <code>list</code> command showing all entries is still maintained, with now 3 added functionalities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-justification-strong-2"><a class="link" href="#strong-justification-strong-2"><strong>Justification</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now list only as many item he wants and need not clutter the screen by displaying all.
It helps him to narrow down his search by being able t specify what indices of the original sources (say by time of addition) what he like to view. This ensures more effective retrieval and
operations on the sources, such as following it by index dependent operations such as <code>edit</code> and <code>delete</code> for instance.</p>

N to M sources are listed with respect to the original source database list with indexes 1, 2 &#8230;&#8203; till (M-N+1).
For valid functioning of the command, the two numbers passed must be positive and the first number must not be greater than the second number.
I.e. both numbers should be non-zero and the second number can only be same or greater than the first number to produce a valid listing of the sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example: <code>list 6 9</code><br>
Lists the 4 sources from index 6 to 9 from the entire database list, indexed from 1, 2 .. till 4 with all their details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some salient features which affect the command&#8217;s working are discussed below:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>An argument passed which more than the current number of sources in the list is reduced to the index of the last source [i.e. the maximum number of sources].
For example, executing <code>list 100</code> when the database has only 50 entries will automatically cap its display to 50 instead of throwing an error.
Similarly, for other command formats too, the listing is capped by the total number of sources and the success message is too altered appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any number of arbitrary spaces between the list command word and its argument is accepted. The <code>command parser</code> will look for the valid command word and
when <code>list command</code> is called, then the numbers will be plucked out in the right order and the appropriate command format will be executed.
For example, 'list 2 3', ' &lt;n spaces&gt; list &lt;x spaces&gt; 2 &lt;y spaces&gt; 3 &lt;z spaces&gt; ' all commands work in the same, intended fashion for all values of n and z and all
non-zero values of x and y.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than two arguments are ignored and only the first two arguments are evaluated as per the 4th case above.
Thus, <code>list 2 3 4</code> and <code>list 2 3 4 &#8230;&#8203;</code> all are executed as <code>list 2 3</code> only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This list feature controls how many sources [based on indices passed] are displayed, <strong>with respect to the original source list</strong> only, and not the one
currently being displayed to the user.
Thus, if   <code>list 2 4</code> is carried out after <code>list 7 10</code> then the list index 2, 3 and 4 of the original list will be outputted and not of this currently displaying list.
Similarly, if a user executes <code>list 3</code> post an operation, say search, then the first three sources of the entire databae are shown and <strong>not</strong> the first three sources of the filtered
list of the resulting search operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having said (4), the new displayed list of sources after the executing of any list operation will update the internally maintained current list displayed, thus any operation [such as <code>edit</code>, <code>delete</code>]
which are based on the indexes of the current displaying list will <strong>still function as per normal</strong> after a list command is executed.
For example, after displaying <code>list 3 5</code>, if a user executes <code>delete 1</code>, it is akin to deleting the 3rd source in the entire list database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sequence diagram of the working of the list command is as below:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ListCommandSequenceDiagram" width="800">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Motivation for such an enhancement is that one may feel that such act of populating <strong>all</strong> the sources on the GUI may be cluttering the view unnecessarily.
Now, what could be the parameters a user may want to limit the list by? Limiting merely by their field values is akin to search,
which would make the logic redundant. In contrast, the user may want to control the number of sources he wants to view, or be able to limit by some sense
of the time at which it was added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This could be helpful in:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Iteratively examining all the sources by restricting how many are shown at one time. The user may begin with listing <code>list 10</code>, then <code>list 11 20</code> and so on to analyze
all the source entries 10 at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making more effective use of the GUI display to the user by not unnecessarily enumerating all sources, but rendering it more powerful by allowing the user to control what and how many sources
he wants to see the details of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabling a pseudo-filtering by time-of-addition of the sources, something the application logic does not support currently [e.g. TimeAdded field]. This is possible because the list command alway alludes
to the original databse list of all the sources, which are by defaul maintained in the order of their addition [with most recent at the end].</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the new modification to the command changes its format optionally, allowing user to be able to pass either one, two or no parameters
and list only those sources which have their indices falling in the range entered [as covered by the cases above].
This may be intuitively useful when say you want to perform certain operations in this new list of sources that are displayed by their time of addition,
since the sources are by default arranged in descending order of their time of addition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example, a user wants to delete all of the sources that were added yesterday. And if 10 entries were added yesterday,
the user could just execute <code>list 10</code> to access those entries and then perform a <code>delete &lt;INDEX&gt;</code> accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original working of the <code>list</code> command showing all entries is still intact, when the command is called without any parameter, thus
this modification just appends extra functionality which renders the command more useful and powerful than it was before in AB4.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, it uses:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_SOURCES</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;when the user does not pass an argument to the list command, all sources must be displayed.
This predicate results <code>true</code> for every source tested. Also, this filtering mode is internally called before <strong>any</strong> list operation so the
command is able to utilize the entire database list in its filtering logic and not just the one currently displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>makePredicateForTopN</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;when the user passes a positive argument, only first N sources must be listed.
This method returns a new object of type <code>Predicate&lt;Source&gt;</code> that keeps track of the <code>count</code> of sources,
evaluating <code>true</code> for the first N sources and <code>false</code> for all the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>makePredicateForLastN</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;when the user passes a negative argument, the last N sources must be listed.
This method returns a new object of the type <code>Predicate&lt;Source&gt;</code> that keeps track of the <code>count</code> of the sources,
evaluating <code>true</code> for the las N sources an <code>false</code> for all others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>makePredicateForXToY</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;when the user passes two positive arguments, the sources between the two indices (included) must be listed.
This method returns a new object of the type <code>Predicate&lt;Source&gt;</code> that keeps track of the <code>count</code> of the sources,
evaluating <code>true</code> for all sources between indices N and M included, and <code>false</code> for all others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>targetIndex</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the number N up to which the most recent sources are to be displayed to the user, in both the positive N and negative N case (case 2 and 3).
It is maintained internally. Set to the current size of the database if the value input is more that this current size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fromIndex</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in the case of two arguments, this is the first index, must be non-zero positive number not greater than the <code>toIndex</code> below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>toIndex</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in the case of two arguments, this is the second index, must be non-zero positive number not less than the <code>fromIndex</code> above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>posFlag</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;internally maintained, passed as <code>true</code> for positive single argument N and <code>false</code> for negative single argument N.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now list only as many item he wants and need not clutter the screen by displaying all.
It helps him to narrow down his search, say should he want to view the N first or last added sources. This ensures more effective retrieval and
operations on the sources, such as following it by index dependent operations such as <code>edit</code> and <code>delete</code> for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some points to note:
- This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future.
- It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. Especially when it came to adding the ability
for the command to be able to work both with 1 parameter and no parameters.
Some design considerations were
<strong> Using variable arguments: in <code>parser</code> method of <code>ListCommandParser</code> class, but this would require changing the
Interface <code>Parser&lt;T&gt;</code>. This technique did not work for making <code>ListCommand</code> objects for the same reason.
</strong> Using method overloading: This did not work for <code>parser</code> method because of the interface restrictions, however
this was used in the constructor of <code>LogicCommand</code> class, creating two objects depending on whether a <code>targetIndex</code> was passed
or not, and whether two indexes where passed or none.
** Using args.length(): Ultimately used in <code>parse</code> method for a simple check whether an
argument is passed and how many are passed.
- The implementation too was challenging, as the current format of <code>list</code> command had to be changed and be prepared to accept and parse optional arguments, with the choice of
 either one or two parameters, ie. implementing overloading functionality
for the list command logic based on whether the number of arguments passed by the user if any.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The <code>Infinity Machine</code> will be initialized with the initial source database state, by default listing all the sources

<p>Step 2. The user executes an <code>add</code> command to add another source entry to the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The user executes <code>list</code> command (with no arguments). All the entries in the database are listed again, showing all the details and

<p>Step 8. The user now executes <code>list 3</code> command. The first 3 entries of the entire source database are listed with all their details, and not the first three of the currently

<p>Step 9. The user now executes <code>list -2</code> and the last two sources from the entire database list (and not the currently displayed list) are shown.</p>

<p>Format: <code>search [n/TITLE] [y/TYPE] [d/DETAILS] [t/TAG] [t/TAG]&#8230;&#8203;</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The search feature is facilitated by <code>Infinity Machine</code>.
It extends <code>Infinity Machine</code> with an find feature, allowing user to search through source entries by the title, type, detail and/or tags, with substring matching.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This search function now has an added functionality of being able to take in multiple
arguments of the type of source fields [i.e. title, type, detail and tags], and search for sources based on that.
It searches in conjunction using multiple fields including title, type, detail and tag(s) input by the user,
listing only those sources that satisfy all the input constraints of the matching fields, with all there corresponding field values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another addition to its functionality is that this search feature is enabled with substring matching as against exact field matching.
This renders this feature more powerful as the user may not always be able to remember exactly the title or tag of the source.
It&#8217;s major usage is in the fact that the user will store the bulk of their data in the details field, and it is unintuitive to have them
list the entire contents of the source in order to match and search it. Thus now, the user is only required to <code>search</code> using
as many consecutive words they are able to recall to narrow the listings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How it works is, it allows the user to search through all the entries in the database through various fields at a time, and display
source entries that satisfy all of the entered tags in conjunction, by checking if the source value contains these parameters.
It allows compound searches to be made, allowing user to narrow down their search, hence helping in efficient retrieval
of the sources, and making working on the database more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, the search is able to find string matches with minor typing errors in the spelling. This feature renders the search more
powerful by accommodating any minor typing error user may make when keying in their search argument. This includes minor flips of two characters
or a missing character or few extra characters etc. The implementation current accounts for less than 5 character swaps needed to transform between the strings.</p>

<p>i.e. misspelling a single word in the title will not be caught unless the entire title is entered, then the
user entry will be matched against the entire title to see if there are less than 5 corrections needed to transform
between the two strings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it may seem that such an additional renders the search feature a bit too general, thus making the search output space
broadened by including more sources that would have otherwise been ignored. But, one may see this as an advantage as:</p>

<p>Obviously, this is targeted at accounting for the slightest chance that the user may have made a typo.</p>

research project as they search for a particular entry. This can help in giving user more ideas about related sources in the same field.</p>

<p>This distance is know as the Levenshtein distance or the edit distance,

one string to the other.</p>

<p>Test case: <code>search i/Algorithm</code><br>
Expected: the source(s) with the word 'algorithm' (case insensitive and minor typo accounted for) in their entire title
string will be showed, with all its details.</p>

<li>
<p>Test case: <code>search i/AlGo i/dataa t/CS</code><br>
Expected: the source(s) with their title containing both the words 'algo', 'data' and tags contain 'cs' will
be displayed with all their details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test case: <code>search i/</code><br>
Expected: list all sources as title can be anything [does not throw an error].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test case: <code>search y/web y/</code><br>
Expected:  the source(s) with their types containing the word 'web' will be displayed with
all their details. Here, the empty tag implies the type can be anything, thus after conjunction, the 'web' constraint
dominates the result.</p>
