<h4 id="1-modified-strong-the-ability-to-search-strong-through-sources"><a class="link" href="#1-modified-strong-the-ability-to-search-strong-through-sources">1. Modified <strong>the ability to search</strong> through sources:</a></h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-previously-strong"><a class="link" href="#strong-previously-strong"><strong>Previously</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>search &lt;title&gt;</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the given codebase of AB4, the <code>search</code> command could only take one type of arguments, of title type, and listed all
sources that have one of those titles present in them.
This search was case-insensitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, when a user executes the command <code>search algorithm</code>, all those sources which have the
title of 'algorithm' (or any of the case combination) will be populated on the GUI, with all their details
such as their titles, types, details and tags. This list will be indexed (numbered). Only exact matches are\
considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This provides the users with limited functionality as they are only able to search through the sources by their titles.
Ideally, we would want to give the user a more powerful search function that allows them to search through the sources
with more fields and parameters, for example used in conjunction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another limitation of the AB4 implementation is that it tests for exact (case insensitive) matching between the keywords
entered by the user and the field values of sources. This is very intuitive because this would expect the user to remember and
recall the exact tag, title, type or detail they had entered when creating the source (or after editing). This is especially useless
when the user stores his entire research data in the <code>detail</code>, say 3 paragraphs, now to reproduce the source he must enter those 3 paragraphs
word to word in their entirety. This defeats the purpose of the user being able to search for a source so he can use it in his
research.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, this format of search only (logically) accepted one argument for each prefix tag, that is if given multiple,
it would jut ignore it. This was implemented by using <code>getValue()</code> on the user enter argument multimap in
<code>SourceContainsKeywordsPredicate</code>. This method only returned the last entered values and used this for the search command logic, ignore
other tags.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-modification-strong"><a class="link" href="#strong-modification-strong"><strong>Modification</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>search [n/TITLE] [y/TYPE] [d/DETAILS] [t/TAG] [t/TAG]&#8230;&#8203;</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work I have done on AB4&#8217;s search feature can be divided into 3 major modifications as follows:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="1-multiple-prefix-tags-of-different-kinds"><a class="link" href="#1-multiple-prefix-tags-of-different-kinds">1. Multiple prefix tags of different kinds:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the implementation of The Infinity Machine, search function now has an added functionality of being able to take in multiple
arguments of the type of source fields, and search for sources based on that.
It searches in conjunction using multiple fields including title, type, detail and tag(s) input by the user,
listing only those sources that satisfy all the input constraints of the matching fields.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="2-substring-matching-with-incomplete-words"><a class="link" href="#2-substring-matching-with-incomplete-words">2. Substring matching with incomplete words:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another addition to its functionality is that this search feature is enabled with substring matching as against exact field matching.
This renders this feature more powerful as the user may not always be able to remember exactly the title or tag of the source.
It&#8217;s major usage is in the fact that the user will store the bulk of their data in the details field, and it is unintuitive to have them
list the entire contents of the source in order to match and search it. Thus now, the user is only required to <code>search</code> using
as many consecutive words they are able to recall to narrow the listings. Eg. searching for <code>d/Artificial Intelligence</code> will
enumerate all source articles that have 'artificial intelligence' in their content.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="3-multiple-prefix-tags-of-one-type"><a class="link" href="#3-multiple-prefix-tags-of-one-type">3. Multiple prefix tags of one type:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, the search command is able to take in multiple arguments of each prefix and search
in conjunction such as all those fields are matched with the corresponding fields of the resulting sources.
This renders this feature more power as now the user is able to search by all that he can recall about the source
entry and be able to narrow down his search more to produce desired results.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-what-it-does-strong"><a class="link" href="#strong-what-it-does-strong"><strong>What it does</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It allows the user to search through all the entries in the database through various fields at a time, and display
source entries that satisfy all of the entered tags in conjunction, with substring matching, and allowing multiple tags of
the same kind.
It allows compound searches to be made, allowing user to narrow down their search, hence helping in efficient retrieval
of the sources, and making working on the database more efficient. It also reduces the onus on the user to remember and recall
the source entries maintained by allowing them to enter as many consecutive characters for a field value they can enumerate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-justification-strong"><a class="link" href="#strong-justification-strong"><strong>Justification</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now search an entry with a particular title AND a particular type and so on.
Furthermore, it removes the reliance on the user to memorize exact field values, by enabling substring matching and multiple tags
entered so the user can enter as much as he remembers and see the results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It helps user greatly narrow down their search should they be looking for a specific source entry with particular values,
instead of cluttering the screen with all those sources with share the same title as the one the user searches using the command.
It also allows user to search sources based on other fields and not just title, such as type, tags and details, and even their
logical combination, along with allowing the user to not memorize his source fields.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, it changed the format of the original <code>search</code> command, which now not only takes parameters of different types, but also needs them to be prefixed by their
CLI delimiters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, as the format of the original command had to be changed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementation too was challenging, as the current format of <code>search</code> command had to be changed and be prepared to
accept and parse multiple fields entered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was also tricky to implement the conjunction of the fields as separate methods had to be written for checking for the presence
of each of the field entered and by logical <code>&amp;&amp;</code> ing their results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was also tricky to implement multiple same prefix tags to be accepted as all values collected from argument multimap in <code>SourceContainsKeywordsPredicate</code> had to be changed
from <code>String</code> from <code>getValue</code> which was used to extract the last value of the specified prefix to <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> from <code>getAllValues()</code> which
extracted argument values of all tags entered by the user without ignoring any. Then the checker methods had to be
modified to implement an <code>AND</code> logic to ensure all these search queries are satisfied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was relatively simple to change exact matching to substring matching by using <code>String.contains()</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was trivial to implement case insensitivity by converting both source value and argument value <code>toLowerCase()</code> before carrying
out the substring comparison.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>list</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In AB4, <code>list</code> command was a very useful feature which displayed to the user all the sources present in the database.
The list command by default displayed all the sources in the order of least recently added first and displayed along with it
all the details of the source, such as title, type, detail and tags.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, when the user executes <code>list</code>, we see the updated list of all the source and their fields.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-modification-strong-2"><a class="link" href="#strong-modification-strong-2"><strong>Modification</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Format: <code>list [n]</code>
inside [] means optional</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, one may feel that such act of populating <strong>all</strong> the sources on the GUI may be cluttering the view unnecessarily.
Now, what could be the parameters a user may want to limit the list by? Limiting merely by their field values is akin to search,
which would make the logic redundant. In contrast, the user may want to control the number of sources he wants to view.
This could be helpful in:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Iteratively examining all the sources by restricting how many are shown at one time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making more effective use of the GUI display to the user by not unnecessarily enumerating all sources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the new modification to the command changes its format optionally, allowing user to be able to pass a parameter
and list only those many sources from the top, that is from the least-recently added. This may be intuitively useful when say
you want to perform certain operations in this new list of sources that are displayed by their time of addition.
Example, a user wants to delete all of the sources that were added yesterday. And if 10 entries were added yesterday,
the user could just execute <code>list 10</code> to access
those entries and then perform a <code>delete &lt;INDEX&gt;</code> accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the user may still execute <code>list</code> command to see the updated list of all the source and their fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now, one may also enter <code>list 21</code> to list the top 21 sources only, allowing user to streamline their retrieval for more
efficient operations on the sources.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="strong-what-it-does-strong-2"><a class="link" href="#strong-what-it-does-strong-2"><strong>What it does</strong>:</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It allows the user to now pass an optional argument to <code>list</code> command, a positive integer n, and then displays only the first n source entries.
The original working of the <code>list</code> command showing all entries is still intact, thus just appending extra functionality without
changing the original logic.</p>

Some design considerations were</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using variable arguments: in <code>parser</code> method of <code>ListCommandParser</code> class, but this would require changing the

</li>
<li>
<p>Using method overloading: This did not work for <code>parser</code> method because of the interface restrictions, however
this was used in the constructor of <code>LogicCommand</code> class, creating two objects depending on whether a <code>targetIndex</code> was passed

<p>The list command is facilitated by <code>Infinity Machine</code>.
It extends <code>Infinity Machine</code> with a list functionality, enumerating all or a specific number of
entries in the source database and their details, in the order of their addition.
It has mainly two usages:<br>
1) Without a parameter, as just <code>list</code> : enumerates all the entries of the source database with their details<br>
2) With a parameter N : where N is a positive integer, enumerates only the top - N or first - N sources from the source database<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Motivation for such an enhancement is that one may feel that such act of populating <strong>all</strong> the sources on the GUI may be cluttering the view unnecessarily.

<p>This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now list only as many item he wants and need not clutter the screen by displaying all.
It helps him to narrow down his search, say should he want to view the N first added sources. This ensures more effective retrieval and
operations on the sources, such as following it by index dependent operations such as <code>edit</code> and <code>delete</code> for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some points to note:
- This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future.
- It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. Especially when it came to adding the ability
for the command to be able to work both with 1 parameter and no parameters.
Some design considerations were
<strong> Using variable arguments: in <code>parser</code> method of <code>ListCommandParser</code> class, but this would require changing the
Interface <code>Parser&lt;T&gt;</code>. This technique did not work for making <code>ListCommand</code> objects for the same reason.
</strong> Using method overloading: This did not work for <code>parser</code> method because of the interface restrictions, however
this was used in the constructor of <code>LogicCommand</code> class, creating two objects depending on whether a <code>targetIndex</code> was passed
or not.
** Using args.length(): Ultimately used in <code>parse</code> method for a simple check whether an
argument is passed or not.
- The implementation too was challenging, as the current format of <code>list</code> command had to be changed and be prepared to accept and parse an optional argument, ie. overloading
functionality based on whether an argument was passed by the user or not.</p>

<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The <code>Infinity Machine</code> will be initialized with the initial source database state, by default listing all the sources
in an indexed fashion, with all details and in order of their addition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user executes an <code>add</code> command to add another source entry to the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The user executes <code>list</code> command (with no arguments). All the entries in the database are listed again, showing all the details and
in the order of their addition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The user now executes <code>delete</code> to delete an entry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. The user executes <code>list</code> command again. All the updated entries in the database, leaving out the last deleted one,  are listed again, showing all the details and

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6. The user now executes <code>list 2</code> command. The first 2 entries akin to the previous output are displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 7. The user now executes <code>list 3 5</code> command. An invalid command format exception is thrown, prompting the user
to enter exactly 1 or no arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 8. The user now executes <code>list 3</code> command. The first 3 entries of the entire source database are listed with all their details.</p>

<p>Format: <code>search [n/TITLE] [y/TYPE] [d/DETAILS] [t/TAG] [t/TAG]&#8230;&#8203;</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The search feature is facilitated by <code>Infinity Machine</code>.
It extends <code>Infinity Machine</code> with an find feature, allowing user to search through source entries by the title, type, detail and/or tags, with substring matching.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This search function now has an added functionality of being able to take in multiple
arguments of the type of source fields [i.e. title, type, detail and tags], and search for sources based on that.
It searches in conjunction using multiple fields including title, type, detail and tag(s) input by the user,
listing only those sources that satisfy all the input constraints of the matching fields, with all there corresponding field values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another addition to its functionality is that this search feature is enabled with substring matching as against exact field matching.
This renders this feature more powerful as the user may not always be able to remember exactly the title or tag of the source.
It&#8217;s major usage is in the fact that the user will store the bulk of their data in the details field, and it is unintuitive to have them
list the entire contents of the source in order to match and search it. Thus now, the user is only required to <code>search</code> using
as many consecutive words they are able to recall to narrow the listings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How it works is, it allows the user to search through all the entries in the database through various fields at a time, and display
source entries that satisfy all of the entered tags in conjunction, by checking if the source value contains these parameters.
It allows compound searches to be made, allowing user to narrow down their search, hence helping in efficient retrieval
of the sources, and making working on the database more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, it uses:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>SourceContainsKeywordsPredicate.java</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Here, the logic of running through all the respective fields of all the sources and matching it with the user inputs
(trimmed by space, case insensitive and take as substring) is implemented. It is split by the CLI prefixes and implements conjunction logic, by only returning <code>true</code>
for those sources that satisfy all the constraints, i.e. have all the fields matching as entered by the user, where matching is checked by if the string
contains the keywords entered by the user (case insensitive).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now search an entry with a particular title AND a particular type and so on.
Not only that, the user can now just input whatever they are able to recall and the <code>search</code> returns all super strings instead of
carrying out an exact matching.
It helps user greatly narrow down their search should they be looking for a specific source entry with particular values,
instead of cluttering the screen with all those sources with share the same title as the one the user searches using the command.
It renders the search more powerful by resulting all super-strings should the user have meant something else or to prompt them about other similar
source entries containing what they are looking for.
It also allows user to search sources based on other fields and not just title, such as type, tags and details, and even their
logical combination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The <code>Infinity Machine</code> will be initialized with the initial source database state, by default listing all the sources
in an indexed fashion, with all details and in order of their addition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user executes <code>search i/footitle1</code> command and only those sources that have their title as <code>footitle1</code> are displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The user executes <code>search i/footitle6 y/website</code> and only those entries are listed that have both their title as <code>footitle1</code> and type as <code>website</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The user executes <code>search t/CS</code> and all those sources that have any of their tags having 'CS' in it listed, including <code>CS2030</code>, <code>CS2040</code> and <code>CS2103</code></p>
