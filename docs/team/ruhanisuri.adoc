== PROJECT: The Infinity Machine

---

== Overview

Introducing the Infinity Machine, an application for efficient storing and
retrieving of textual information on research material by allowing users to
apply to it custom made tags and type for easy search and retrieval. Intended
for tech-savvy university students who are able to use CLI and wish to organize
 and tag research information or any other data that they may wish to store.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to search through sources*
** What it does: allows the user to search through all the entries in the database through various fields at a time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now search an entry with a particular title AND a particular type and so on.
** Highlights: This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging.
