== PROJECT: Infinity Machine

---

== Overview

Infinity Machine is a source manager to be used by tech-savvy university students who are comfortable with the command line interface (CLI).
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add, remove, and manage command aliases*
** What it does: allows the user to define custom aliases for commands, which persist across sessions
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can:
(1) create custom memorable alises for any of the existing commands;
(2) work more efficiently by creating shortcuts for lengthy and commonly-used commands
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the way user input is parsed and executed,
both for existing commands and commands to be added in the future.
It required an extensive analysis of various design approaches.
The implementation was challenging because:
*** There are different classes of commands that are parsed and handled in different ways.
This enhancement must be agnostic to these various classes of commands,
and must potentially work with any new future classes.
*** This enhancement must both be backward-compatible with existing commands and also transparent to implementors of future commands.
In other words, this enhancement will work seamlessly with any future command implementations, even if the implementors have no knowledge of this enhancement.


* *Minor enhancement*: added a panic/unpanic mode command that allows the user to quickly hide the current list of sources from display.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Command aliases : `alias`
==== Creating an alias: `alias`
Allows the user to create aliases create aliases for commands. +
Format: `alias COMMAND ALIAS`

Examples:

* `alias count c` (`c` is now a valid pseudo-command that works exactly like `count`)
* `alias invalid i` (`i` is now an invalid pseudo-command that works exactly like `invalid`)

The user is responsible for ensuring that he is creating aliases for valid commands.
The successful creation of an alias does not provide any guarantee of the validity of the associated command.

If the user attempts to add an alias that has already been added, the old one will be overwritten. For example:

* `alias count c`
* `alias invalid c`

`c` is now an alias for the invalid command `invalid`.

The command may not be another alias. The alias may not be a command.

* `alias count ct` (`ct` is now an alias for `count`)
* `alias ct c` (this is invalid because `ct` is another alias)
* `alias count list` (this is invalid because `list` is a command)

The alias must be syntatically valid. A valid syntax may only contain alphabets.

* `alias list l` (valid)
* `alias count ct` (valid)
* `alias clear $` (invalid)

==== Removing an alias: `alias-rm`
Allows the user to remove previously-defined aliases. +
Format: `alias-rm ALIAS`

Examples:

* `alias count c` (`c` is now an alias for `count`)
* `alias-rm c` (`c` is no longer an alias for `count`)

If the user attempts to remove a non-existent alias, nothing happens.
`alias-rm` only guarantees that after it is performed, the alias argument does not exist.

==== Listing all aliases: `alias-ls`
Lists all defined aliases and their associated commands. +
Format: `alias-ls`

==== Alias persistence
Aliases are persistent across usage sessions.
When an alias is created or removed, this is recorded to disk.
No action is required on the user's part.

=== Command Alias feature
The command alias feature allows users to use shorthand commands to rapidly "get things done", for instance using `a` instead of `add`, or `c` instead of `count`.

Users may do one of the following:
1) Add a new alias
2) Remove an existing alias
3) List all aliases

==== Overview:

This feature is backed by an in-memory database implemented as a Java `HashMap<String, String>`.
A HashMap is chosen for several reasons:

* Adding and removing an alias is straightforward (using Java HashMap API) and efficient (`O(1)` time)
* Checking whether an alias exists is fast (`O(1)` time)
* HashMaps naturally facilitate the process of looking up an associated value with a given key

*Alternative*: An alternative implementation could use a Java `ArrayList`.
However, that adds additional code complexity, as there needs to be a way of associating 2 strings.
For instance, we could create an `ArrayList<AliasWrapper>`, where `AliasWrapper` is a wrapper class to associate 2 strings.
However, that is inelegant and inefficient, as opposed to a `HashMap` solution.
Furthermore, checking for membership in an `ArrayList` is an `O(N)` operation in an unsorted list, or `O(log(N))` in a sorted list.

Therefore, due to the key-value association inherent in the idea of an alias manager, a `HashMap` is the most approriate data structure.

==== Operation:

SourceManagerParser detects when a meta-command is entered.
A meta-command is one that pertains to AliasManager (and by association SourceManagerParser), e.g. `alias`, `alias-rm`, `alias-ls`, etc.

AliasManager exposes the meta-commands it "uses", which SourceManagerParser relies on for detection.
However, it is acknowledged that this is not strictly necessary.
It is safe for SourceManagerParser to redefine these meta-commands.
The default meta-commands that AliasManager exposes should be thought of as recommended, but not mandatory, meta-commands.
AliasManager is fundamentally command-agnostic; it does not care what meta-commands are actually used.

When a meta-command is detected to have been entered, SourceManagerParser delegates it to the appropriate AliasMetaCommandParser to handle.
For instance, `alias FOO BAR` is delegated to the AliasAddMetaCommandParser (a concrete subclass of AliasMetaCommandParser) with the arguments "FOO BAR".
The AliasMetaCommandParser concrete subclasses parses the arguments and returns a DummyCommand response object.

[NOTE]

This delegation design pattern is chosen for 2 reasons:
Firstly, it hides complexity in SourceManagerParser by abstracting the logic of interacting with AliasManager away.
This makes SourceManagerParser more readable, declarative, and maintainable.
This also allows us to practice the Single Responsibility Principle and Single Layer of Abstraction Principle, among others.
Secondly, it improves testability by facilitating unit testing of smaller blocks of logic, rather than a single giant block.

In normal operation, when the user uses an alias, SourceManagerParser parses the user input to extract the "command word".
It checks whether the "command word" is an alias using AliasManager's `isAlias()` method.
If so, it fetches the original command that the alias is associated to using AliasManager's `getCommand()` method
(which returns an `Optional<String>` - this forces the caller to unwrap the optional and avoids null pointer exceptions).

Finally, SourceManagerParser recursively calls itself using the original command retrieved from AliasManager to execute the original command that the alias is associated with.

**Alternative:** An alternative implementation could be to modify the `HashMap<String, String>` in AliasManager into `HashMap<String, Class<? extends Command>>`. The value is thus a Command class.
When a valid alias is used, AliasManager would instantiate the associated class and return the instance.
However, this implementation is disfavored, for the following reasons.

Firstly, SourceManagerParser works with both Command classes and Parser classes.
Some commands, for instance `add`, have accompanying arguments to be parsed.
For these "parsable commands", SourceManagerParser instantiates a CommandParser and calls its `.parse()` method.
For other "non-parsable commands", for instance `clear`, SourceManagerParser instantiates and returns the command directly.

Therefore, if we were to adopt this implementation, we would require 2 separate HashMaps mapping aliases to `Class<? extends Command>` and `Class<? extends Parser<? extends Command>>`.
This introduces a lot of complexity into AliasManager, and results in some duplication of logic across SourceManagerParser and AliasManager.
Specifically, the logic that distinguishes between commands/aliases that map to `Command` and those that map to `Parser` will be duplicated in both SourceManagerParser and AliasManager.
This violates the DRY principle.

Furthermore, doing so increases coupling across the project, as there are now associations between AliasManager and the various Commands/Parsers. We want to minimize coupling whenever possible.

Therefore, by simply mapping aliases to commands, and having a single layer of recursion in SourceManagerParser whereby it calls itself with the actual command, we avoid all the above problems.
We improve cohesion, reduce coupling, drastically reduce complexity, and improve testability.

==== Persistence:
The usefulness of aliases would be significantly diminished if they do not persist between sessions.
Therefore, we want aliases to be stored on disk and automatically loaded in future sessions.

To accomplish this, we create an `AliasStorage` interface, and an implementing class `ConcreteAliasStorage`.
We also modify AliasManager to instantiate ConcreteAliasStorage upon its own instantiation.

ConcreteAliasStorage is responsible for reading/writing from/to disk,
and therefore converting the in-memory database (HashMap object) of aliases into/from an encoded representation.
When AliasManager's aliases database is mutated (i.e. create or remove alias), it calls ConcreteAliasStorage's `saveAliases()` method.

[NOTE]

**Alternative:** A more elegant implementation would be to apply the observer pattern,
with the observer observing the aliases HashMap database, and calling `saveAliases()` when it is mutated.
However, given the simplicity of AliasManager, we believe that applying the observer pattern will result in unnecessary overhead,
with minimal (or no) tangible benefits.
Firstly, the aliases HashMap database is a private field, and only accessible within AliasManager.
Secondly, there are only 2 methods which would mutate the aliases HashMap database.

Within ConcreteAliasStorage, its `saveAliases()` method encodes aliases and commands into a string,
in the following format: `alias1:command1;alias2:command2;alias3:command3`.
Conversely, `readAliases()` parses this string and reconstructs the aliases HashMap database.

[NOTE]

**Alternative:** We opted to use our own very simple encoding scheme instead of JSON.
JSON is more suited for "document-like" objects with different properties, some of which are possibly nested multiple layers.
However, in our case, we only have a series of key:value pairs, in a predictable form, with no nesting.
Therefore, we thought that a simple semicolon-separated key:value pair encoding scheme would suffice.
